["Some things never change Never trust a dog to watch your food. — Patrick, age 10 Our country has witnessed sweeping changes—from the untamed wild times of Buffalo Bill to the techno-logical era of Bill Gates—but food has never lost its central role in our lives. Food not only sustains life but also enriches us in many ways. It warms us on cold, dreary days, entices us with its many aromas, and provides end-less variety to the everyday world. Food is also woven into the fabric of our Nation, our culture, our insti-tutions, and our families. Food is on the scene when we celebrate and when we mourn. We use it for camaraderie, as a gift, and as a reward (and sometimes as a crutch). We are all aware of how food has changed. At the turn of the 20 th century, home cooking and canning were fixtures of life in America. Lard, seasonal vegetables, potatoes, and fresh meats were the staples of our diet. And 40 percent of Americans lived on farms. Today, con-venience foods and dining out are common. Ethnic diversity has influenced our tastes and the variety of foods available. Technology and trade allow us to enjoy most foods all year round. And only 1 percent of the population grows our food, while 9 percent are involved in the food system in some way—in processing, wholesaling, retailing, serv-ice, marketing, and inspection. What Americans often forget, however, is the remarkable system that delivers to us the most abundant, reasonably priced, and safest food in the world. The American food system—from the farmer to the consumer—is a series of intercon-nected parts. The farmer produces the food, the processors work their magic, and the wholesalers and retailers deliver the products to consumers, whose choices send market signals back through the system. Every piece fits every other piece, notwithstanding an occasional gap and pinch. Our mission at the Economic Research Service (ERS) is to understand this system and effectively communicate our findings to the players in the system. Some of those gaps and pinches currently receiving ERS scrutiny include obesity and food choices, the need for better targeting of food assistance benefits, as well as the environmental impacts of agriculture. The challenges of biotech foods and of emerging global markets and competitors (including Brazil, China, and Ukraine) are also among the issues analyzed by ERS. At the end of the day, it is safe to say the U.S. food system has done a remarkable job of using technology and inventiveness to its advantage and ultimately to the benefit of the consumer. We get the foods we want, when we want them, in the form we want them, all at affordable prices. Thanks to this system, Americans spend less of their income on food than do consumers anywhere else in the world. Despite the dramatic evolution of the American food system, there are some constants in our ever-changing world. Americans will always love food. The American food system will continue to adapt, grow, and provide us with the products we desire. And yes, that timeless advice stands: Never trust a dog to watch your food. James R.

The U.S. remains the largest exporter, but U.S. farmers are increasingly producing other crops, like corn and soybeans, so the U.S. share of the wheat market has fallen from 40 percent in the 1970s to 23 percent (forecast) for 2002/03. This shift in U.S. agricultural production, combined with rising prices caused by drought in three of the largest exporters—U.S., Australia, and Canada—has created opportunities for “nontraditional” wheat exporters. With their favorable climates and large land bases, the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Central and Eastern Europe are traditional places for wheat production. Reductions in agricultural subsidies dur-ing the 1990s, however, caused a sharp drop in livestock production, which, in turn, curtailed domestic demand for wheat as an animal feed. While wheat output also fell, recent large harvests, caused largely by favorable weather, have supported wheat exports. FSU wheat exports surged in 2001/02 and 2002/03 as increasing world prices generated the investment needed to expand port capacity. In 2002/03, Russia is expected to be the world’s third largest wheat exporter, behind the U.S. and the European Union (EU). India, Pakistan, and China have also become net exporters of wheat in recent years. High government production sup-ports during the 1990s boosted production and stocks. When the cost of maintaining these stocks became burdensome, exports increased, particularly as prices increased in 2002/03. However, these opportunistic exports are not expected to persist because these countries are unable to pro-duce wheat cheaply enough to sustain increased exports without large subsidies. The EU continues to be a large wheat exporter. Historically, EU wheat produc-tion and exports depended on large subsidies. Despite lower domestic wheat prices, EU wheat production has grown because of favorable net returns compared with those for other crops. Lower prices have increased the domestic feed use of wheat, limiting exports. The U.S. is expected to remain the world’s largest wheat exporter, though its share will likely decline if U.S. producers continue to turn to other crops and if other countries find wheat profitable. As export shares shift, changes in U.S. supply will not affect prices as much as in the past. For example, when the U.S., Canada, and Australia suffered from drought in 2002/03, nontraditional exporters and the EU were able to export enough to keep a lid on prices.

Both countries supported commodity prices through pur-chase and storage of surplus commodities. The U.S. relied more on producer loans secured by commodities and acreage con-trols, while the EU relied more on export subsidies to dispose of surpluses. Both the U.S. and the EU have significantly changed their commodity policies in the past decade. While their policies have evolved in similar directions in some respects, important differences remain. Both the U.S. and the EU have reduced their reliance on price support for several commodities for the same reasons: to improve their competitiveness, reduce burdensome stocks associated with high support prices, and rein in rising costs of operating commodity programs. Both countries now make greater use of income support through payments to producers. Lower support prices and govern-ment purchases have reduced the need for surplus disposal, including export subsidies. Since 1995, U.S. use of export subsidies has been limited essentially to dairy products and poultry. The EU con-tinues to use export subsidies for many price-supported commodities, although World Trade Organization (WTO) obliga-tions have required the EU to reduce subsidy levels. Despite similarities in policy changes, EU and U.S. policies differ. The EU main-tains a higher overall support level to its farm sector and relies more on price sup-port than does the United States. Although some EU support prices have been reduced, higher tariffs contribute to market price support by pre-venting the entry of lower priced imports. Both U.S. and EU agricultural policies will continue to respond to domestic needs, the interna-tional environment, and obligations under trade agreements. In addition, public pres-sure on broader issues, including envi-ronmental protection, rural development, and food safety, is increasingly shaping agricultural policy.

Large shares of com-mon crops, such as corn and soybeans, are grown from bioengineered seed. Many processed foods on U.S. supermarket shelves contain biotech ingredients. Labeling of biotech foods has been a contentious issue in the U.S. and between the U.S. and its trading partners. Proponents of mandatory biotech food labeling argue that consumers have a right to know how their food has been pro-duced. Opponents argue that such labeling will confuse and, in many cases, unneces-sarily alarm consumers. In the U.S., when biotechnology introduces a known allergen or substantially changes a food’s nutrition-al content or composition, Federal regula-tions require that the label indicate this change. So far, no biotech foods on the market have required labeling. In 2001, ERS and university researchers held experimental auctions to gauge consumers’ willingness to pay for food items with and without biotech labels. In the absence of sales data, exper-imental auctions more closely simulate purchasing behavior and better gauge consumer preferences than surveys of consumer attitudes. Auction participants could bid on and purchase three different food products—potatoes, vegetable oil, and corn tortilla chips—with and without a label indicating that the food contained biotech ingredients. None of the foods had biotech-enhanced attributes or traits that could be detected without sophisticated testing technologies, if at all. Before the bidding, each participant received one of six information packets containing statements about biotech-nology gathered from a variety of sources. Information played a powerful role in shaping how the participants responded to biotech foods. They reacted not just to the information itself, but also to whether the information came from biotech firms, an environmental advocacy group, or independent third-party sources. Participants who received only pro-biotech information actually put a slight average premium of 2 percent on the biotech-labeled foods relative to foods without biotech labels for two of the three products. Participants who received only anti-biotech information discounted the biotech-labeled foods by an average of 36 percent. Those who received both pro- and anti-biotech information discounted the biotech-labeled foods by an average of 23 percent. Interestingly, participants placed a greater weight on negative information than on positive information, a result consistent with other studies. The ERS study also looked at the role of science-based information on consumer attitudes towards biotech foods. Abebayehu Tegene, ategene@ers.usda.gov This finding is drawn from . . .

","7 AMBER WAVES JUNE 2003 F I N D I N G S DIET AND HEALTH Recent changes in the structure of the pork industry echo past changes in the poultry industry. How U.S. pork producers and processors sell and buy hogs has changed significantly since 1990. The use of long-term contracts has largely replaced production for the open, or spot, market. Over 70 percent of hogs are sold under contracts, where producers are required to deliver a specified number of hogs to the processor at a specified time. In return, the producer receives the spot price, adjusted for the size and quality of the hogs. These developments raise concerns by some about anticom-petitive behavior of large processors and the demise of small, independent farmers. Others emphasize how contracts facilitate steady flows of high-quality farm products for processing, among other benefits. In the U.S. poultry industry, contracts and common owner-ship of production and processing (called “vertical integration”) expanded in the 1950s. By 1977, contracts and vertical integration accounted for over 85 percent of broiler, turkey, and egg production. Today, these arrangements account for over 90 percent of production in each of the three sectors. At the same time, the poultry industry significantly improved production efficiencies. It also capitalized on consumers’ interest in lower fat sources of pro-tein and responded to their quest for convenience with a wide variety of processed, branded poultry products. These develop-ments were reflected in large supplies of poultry products that were priced low relative to other meats. The pork indus-try has also improved production efficiency. Offspring from a typi-cal breeding hog pro-duced 30 percent more pork in 1999 than in 1990. The industry is offering more lean, further-processed, case-ready products. From 1995 to 1999, the number of new pork items on foodservice menus more than doubled, and the number of pork mentions on menus exceeded all other meats in 1999, except for chicken, according to a study by the National Pork Producers Council. These efficiencies and expanded product offerings have led to larger pork supplies that have lowered pork prices and may have tempered declines in demand dating back to the 1970s. From 1990 to 2002, pork production increased by 2 percent per year, and deflated retail pork prices fell by 1 percent per year. From 1980 to 1995, the demand for pork fell by 34 percent. Since 1995, the demand for pork has increased by 8 percent. The pork industry is also following the lead of poultry in export markets. The U.S. poultry industry has experienced consid-erable growth in exports, as indicated by its status as the world’s largest exporter of poultry meat. Similarly, reliable supplies tailored to customer specifications have helped boost U.S. pork exports fivefold in the 1990s. Steve Martinez , martinez@ers.usda.gov This finding is drawn from . . .

Because manure is expensive to transport, producers may apply more than crops can use, especially on fields nearest the production facility. Excessive manure applications increase the potential for contamination of surface and ground water. To address water quality concerns, USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) together developed a strategy for improv-ing manure management. A primary emphasis of the joint strate-gy is to limit application of manure nutrients to rates that the soil can store and crops can use. USDA will provide technical and financial assistance to help operators develop and implement comprehensive nutrient management plans (CNMPs). EPA pub-lished regulations in February 2003 that will require over 15,000 concentrated animal feeding operations to implement CNMPs. This emphasis on manure management presents a new challenge to large livestock and poultry operations, particularly in areas with relatively high animal concentrations such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which covers parts of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. Recent ERS analysis indicates that better manure manage-ment will likely require manure to be applied to more land than currently, raising hauling costs for many animal producers. An operator’s need to access additional land for manure application will depend on the volume of manure for disposal relative to crop-land area currently receiving manure and the nutrient uptake of the crops. The willingness of crop farmers to accept manure on their land—considering manure’s variable nutrient content, potential odor, and handling cost—affects the amount of land available for manure application and the distance manure must be hauled. A low willingness by crop producers to accept manure may cause some manure to be hauled long distances to access sufficient land to avoid overapplication of manure nutrients. As part of the ERS study, analysts examined the feasibility and cost of applying manure in the Chesapeake Bay watershed at rates not exceeding crop uptake. For all the nitrogen in manure to be used by crops within 100 miles of the manure’s origin, crop farmers in the region would have to accept manure as the only nitrogen fertilizer source on at least 20 percent of total cropland. Under a more stringent standard, where applied manure does not exceed crop phosphorus needs, crop farmers within a 100-mile radius would have to accept manure as the only phosphorous source on at least 60 percent of the total cropland. USDA financial and technical assistance in managing and utilizing the nutrients in manure could increase crop farmers’ willingness to accept manure application on their land. Where hauling costs for manure land application are high, the ERS analysis indicates potential to reduce the amount of land receiving manure by expanding industrial processes that use manure to produce energy or commercial fertilizer products, and by feeding animal rations that lessen manure nutrient content.

Growing at an unprecedented rate, the world’s pop-ulation reached 3 billion, and a third of those were undernourished. Forty years later, the world’s popula-tion has doubled to 6 billion, but food production has grown even faster, and fewer people are undernourished. Rising food demand led to higher input use and improved technology and efficiency. Even so, more than 800 million people—mostly in Asia and Africa—remain undernour-ished. For many of these people, secure and sustainable access to sufficient food for active, healthy lives—food security— depends on income from agriculture, and thus on the productivity of agricultural land and labor. World-average cereal yields rose by more than 2 percent per year during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by the improved seed varieties and increased input use of the Green Revolution. However, yield growth has slowed since then and the Food and Agriculture Organi-zation (FAO) projects that cereal yield growth will slow to a global aver-age of 0.8 percent per year over the next three decades. Do soil erosion, soil fertility depletion, and other forms of land degradation threaten the productivity gains achieved in the past? Could Malthus be right after all? Because relevant data are scarce, the extent to which yields have been reduced by land degradation has been difficult to determine. Recent analysis by ERS economists, in collabora-tion with soil scientists at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and Ohio State University, finds that yield losses to soil erosion vary widely by crop and region, but average 0.3 percent per year worldwide when farmers’ practices are held constant. Given FAO’s projections of slower yield growth, further yield losses of this magnitude could reverse recent reduc-tions in the number of people who are food insecure. However, farmers’ practices do change over time in response to chang-ing conditions, so actual yield losses to land degradation are typically lower. For example, ERS analysis finds that yield losses to soil erosion in the North-Central U.S. are less than 0.1 percent per year when farmers choose management prac-tices that are most profitable over the long term. ERS research suggests that land degradation does not threaten food securi-ty at a global scale, but impacts vary by location. Yield losses due to land degrada-tion do pose problems in areas where soils are shallow, fields are steeply sloped, property rights are insecure, and farmers have limited access to inputs, informa-tion, and markets. Any further slowing of yield growth in the future would increase the importance of measures to address these challenges. Keith Wiebe, kdwiebe@ers.usda.gov This finding is drawn from . . .

FAO photo/I. Valdez ","Rural workers in jobs with low skill requirements declined as a share of all rural workers during the 1990s, a decade when technological change seemed to favor high-skill urban-oriented economic activities. The share of workers in low-skill jobs declined more in rural areas (2.2 percentage points) than in cities and suburbs (1.1 percentage point) in the 1990s. This trend suggests that rural workers as a whole are participating in the long-term national movement toward a more skill-intensive economy marked by higher labor productivity and wages. The low-skill workforce includes a majority of the rural working poor and near-poor pop-ulation, who are the focus of recent Federal policy initiatives designed to ensure a sustainable wage. By 2000, 42 percent of rural America’s 25 million workers were employed in jobs with low skill requirements (6 percentage points above the national average). According to ERS research, the declining share of rural workers in low-skill jobs resulted from a shift in industrial employment from the goods-producing sector to the service sector. Mining and manufacturing, major forces in the goods sector, have historically required a large number of workers with limited skills, but now employ a much smaller proportion of the rural workforce than in previous decades. On the other hand, service employment, with typically higher verbal and quantitative skill requirements, grew rapidly. A shift within the service sector toward less-skilled jobs, however, offset the drop in goods-producing employment. Most of the recent decline in the low-skill share of rural employment is attributable to occupational shifts within industries, with the most pronounced shift in the goods sector. These shifts reflect a growing demand for workers engaged in high-skill activities, such as administra-tion and research associated with corporate headquarters. Moreover, tech-nological advances in the way that goods and services are produced favor workers who can perform more complex tasks and are more proficient in verbal and quanti-tative skills. Other recent evidence corroborates the picture of skill upgrading in rural America. ERS research on rural and urban differences in computer use and the adoption of advanced production technologies in manufacturing has found that technological skills are being upgrad-ed at about the same rate in rural and urban establishments. Furthermore, educational attainment, which closely tracks skill measures, rose as quickly among rural adults as among urban adults in the 1990s. In some rural communities, the loss of low-skill jobs creates a hardship for workers lacking training opportunities or alternative employment. But the growth in expertise and skills needed for a more technologically advanced economy should benefit the rural workforce overall. These trends are primarily evidenced by shifts in the employment mix within industries, rather than by the employment shifts between industries that often attract the most attention.
